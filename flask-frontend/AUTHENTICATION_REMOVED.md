# Authentication Removed

This Flask frontend has been updated to work without authentication. The following changes were made:

## 1. API Client Updates (`api_client.py`)
- Removed authentication header injection in `_get_headers()`
- Removed `login()`, `logout()`, and `check_auth()` methods
- Removed `api_auth_required` decorator
- Updated error handling to not redirect to login on 401 errors

## 2. Route Updates
- **Students Routes** (`app/routes/students.py`): Removed `@api_auth_required` decorator from create, edit, and delete routes
- **Courses Routes** (`app/routes/courses.py`): 
  - Removed `login_required` decorator function
  - Removed `@login_required` decorator from create, edit, delete, enroll, and unenroll routes
  - Updated enroll/unenroll methods to accept student_id from form instead of session
- **Enrollments Routes** (`app/routes/enrollments.py`): Removed `@api_auth_required` decorator from all routes

## 3. Template Updates
- **base.html**: Removed login/logout navigation and user dropdown
- **index.html**: Removed authentication checks, made all features accessible
- **students/view.html**: Removed authentication checks for edit/delete buttons
- **students/list.html**: Removed authentication checks for add/edit buttons
- **courses/list.html**: Removed authentication checks for add/edit buttons
- **courses/detail.html**: Updated enrollment/unenrollment to use student ID input fields

## 4. App Configuration (`app.py`)
- Commented out auth blueprint registration

## Important Notes

1. **Security**: This removes all authentication, making all operations publicly accessible. In a production environment, you would want proper authorization at the API level.

2. **Enrollment/Unenrollment**: Since there's no logged-in user, the course detail page now shows input fields for student ID when enrolling/unenrolling.

3. **Session Data**: The app still uses Flask-Session for storing temporary data, but no user information is stored.

4. **API Authentication**: The API client no longer sends authentication headers. Make sure your backend API is configured to work without authentication or has its own authentication mechanism.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all routes work without authentication:
```bash
python test_no_auth.py
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask app
python run.py
# or
flask run
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000
