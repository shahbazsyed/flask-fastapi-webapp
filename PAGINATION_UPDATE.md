# Pagination Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the FastAPI backend to return paginated responses instead of plain lists, making it compatible with the Flask frontend expectations.

## Changes Made

### 1. FastAPI Backend Updates

#### Schema Changes (`app/schemas.py`)
- Added a generic `PaginatedResponse[T]` schema that includes:
  - `items`: List of items for the current page
  - `total`: Total count of items
  - `page`: Current page number
  - `per_page`: Number of items per page

#### Endpoint Updates (`main.py`)
Updated the following endpoints to return paginated responses:

1. **Students Endpoints**
   - `GET /students` - Returns paginated list of students
   - `GET /enrollments/student/{student_id}` - Returns paginated enrollments for a student

2. **Courses Endpoints**
   - `GET /courses` - Returns paginated list of courses
   - `GET /enrollments/course/{course_id}` - Returns paginated enrollments for a course

3. **Enrollments Endpoints**
   - `GET /enrollments` - Returns paginated list of all enrollments

### 2. Flask Frontend Updates

Updated all routes that consume the API to handle the new paginated response format:

#### Students Routes (`app/routes/students.py`)
- Updated `list_students()` to extract items from the paginated response
- Updated `student_enrollments()` to handle paginated enrollments

#### Courses Routes (`app/routes/courses.py`)
- Updated `list_courses()` to use the paginated response
- Updated `view_course()` to handle paginated enrollments
- Updated `unenroll_course()` to handle paginated response when finding enrollment

#### Enrollments Routes (`app/routes/enrollments.py`)
- Updated `index()` to handle paginated enrollments list
- Updated `student_enrollments()` to handle paginated responses
- Updated `course_enrollments()` to handle paginated responses

## Response Format

All list endpoints now return responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "items": [...],     // Array of items for current page
  "total": 100,       // Total number of items
  "page": 1,          // Current page number (1-based)
  "per_page": 20      // Number of items per page
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Frontend no longer needs to fetch all items to get counts
2. **Consistency**: All list endpoints use the same pagination format
3. **Scalability**: Better handling of large datasets
4. **Frontend Compatibility**: Matches the expected format in the Flask frontend

## Testing

Created `test_pagination.py` script to verify pagination functionality:
- Tests all paginated endpoints
- Verifies response structure
- Tests pagination with different page sizes
- Tests search functionality with pagination

## Migration Notes

- The API is backward compatible for endpoints that accept `skip` and `limit` parameters
- Page calculation is done using: `page = (skip // limit) + 1`
- All existing functionality is preserved while adding pagination metadata
